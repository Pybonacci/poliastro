Contributing
============

poliastro is a community project, hence all contributions are more than
welcome!

Bug reporting
-------------

Not only things break all the time, but also different people have different
use cases for the project. If you find anything that doesn't work as expected
or have suggestions, please refer to the `issue tracker`_ on GitHub.

.. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can always be improved and made easier to understand for
newcomers. The docs are stored in text files under the `docs/source`
directory, so if you think anything can be improved there please edit the
files and proceed in the same way as with `code writing`_.

The Python classes and methods also feature inline docs: if you detect
any inconsistency or opportunity for improvement, you can edit those too.

Besides, the `wiki`_ is open for everybody to edit, so feel free to add
new content.

Code writing
------------

Code contributions are welcome! Just send a pull request and we'll discuss it.
In the `wiki`_ you can find some documents explaining the overall design of
poliastro, and in the `issue tracker`_ you may find pending tasks waiting for
someone to complete them.

All new features should be thoroughly tested, and in the ideal case the
coverage rate should increase or stay the same. Automatic services will ensure
your code works on all the operative systems and package combinations
poliastro support.
