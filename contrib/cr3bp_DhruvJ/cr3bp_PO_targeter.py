Objective: This file contains functions required to target a Periodic Orbit in the Circular Restricted
    Three Body Problem (CR3BP) model

    Features:
        1. Setup multiple nodes to use a Multiple Shooter Targeter
        2. (will be added)Periodic Orbit Multiple Shooter Targeter (Acts as a single shooter if n_node == 1)
        3. (will be added)Newton-Raphson Solver

    Calculate states of n_nodes and time between each node
    Patch point placement strategy:
        1) Computes the n_nodes placed after NEARLY equal time intervals
        2) Computes the n_nodes placed after NEARLY equal time history INDEX
            (This might be better as more integration steps are taken in sensitive
             regions and placing the nodes by using index will place more points
             in the sensitive regions)

    First Node = I.C. of trajectory
    If symmetry is to be leverage to target a P.O.: last Node propagated by time 't' reaches the vicinity of the desired final state

    Parameters
    ----------
    mu :  float, M2/(M1+M2)
        M1 and M2 are mass of Primary Bodies and M2<M1
    ic : numpy ndarray (6x1), {Can handle all 42 states for CR3BP+STM integration}
        States are defined about the barycenter of the two primaries, P1 and P2
        Initial condition: 6 states to compute a trajectory];
        [0:x0, 1:y0, 2:z0, 3:vx0, 4:vy0, 5:vz0] [non-dimensional] [nd]
    tf : float
        Integration time [nd]
        Can be negative or positive, negative => Integration in backwards time
    n_node : int, Number of nodes
        IC is node 1 and nth node is node when propagated by tn value should reach the vicinity of the desired final state
    node_place_opt : string, optional
        'time': Computes the n_nodes placed after NEARLY equal time intervals
        'index': Computes the n_nodes placed after NEARLY equal time history INDEX
    int_tol : float, optional
        Absolute = Relative Integration Tolerance
        The default is 1e-12.

    Returns
    -------
    ic_node : list, ndarray, float64
        Stores the IC of the n_node, where  ic_node[0] = ic0
    t_node : list, float
        Stores the time from one node to the next, t_node[-1]: time to reach the desired state (somekind of corrsing)
